Dear Calin,  

Like every year, I hope that this year brings you everything you wish for. But this year, I know for sure, is going to be a special year. 

On your birthday, I’d like to reflect on how far you’ve come since I’ve known you - over a decade now! Why is that so hard to believe? Let’s see... 

I vividly remember the dreamy 20-something boy with disheveled hair and a breath-of-fresh-air kind of attitude - always whipping around town on a bike and showing up at my parents’ home with wild flowers whenever I came home to visit from university. 

I also remember the guy who talked excitedly about space and whose eyes sparkled whenever he explained something to me to do with mechanics (I promise, I was listening). 

And I remember the guy who took me out to eat at a hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese place for one of our first dates opening up a whole new world of food for me. 

You’re the guy who taught me all about “good” music and the “great small joys”. 

You wrote me love letters and little poems in a world of social media and I cherish you for that.   
  
You created big and small adventures for us. Then you got really serious and asked me to marry you, to have even more adventures with you, to build a family with you, and to grow old with you. 

Through it all, we’ve made each other better people. I see us fulfilling dreams we made along the way and creating a life and a love more profound than I could’ve ever imagined. 

Now I see an accomplished man in every sense. Most importantly, I see a man who will make a great father; leading by example - not by advice. I hope our child gets your drive and sense of kindness. I also seriously hope he gets your great eyebrows and your athletic genes, ha. Seriously though, all this hoping aside -- I just know that he will be so lucky to have you as a father as I am lucky to have you as a partner. 

With profound love and respect... always yours,

  
Hiba

P.S. Here are some photos I _**love**_ of you!  
These are more for me, really. A nice walk down memory lane 😘
