## Shakshuka / Eggs in Purgatory

More than just eggs ;)

- 8 eggs ((2/person))
- 6 tbsp olive oil
- 2 shallots (diced)
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- ¼ tsp sumac
- ¼ tsp cumin
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 can diced tomatoes
- 2 tbsp red pepper paste
- salt (to taste )
- handful of cilantro/parsley/arugula/basil (for garnish (so whatever you prefer or nothing))

1. Put olive oil in a pan on medium heat
    
2. Add diced shallots and let cook for a couple of minutes until somewhat soft
    
3. Add all spices into the oil and shallot mix (paprika, coriander, cumin, sumac) to bloom flavours
    
4. After another 2 minutes, you can add the red pepper paste and mix everything
    
5. Then add can of diced tomatoes (you can use fresh if you like) and bay leaf
    
6. Cover and let simmer for 10 minutes or so
    
7. When it starts bubbling, uncover and start cracking the eggs and carefully add them in
    
8. Cover and cook for another couple of minutes - when it starts to harden, you can turn off the element and let it cook with the leftover heat.
    
    \*If you want jammy yolks, wait for the white part to become totally white then uncover and take off the heat.
    
9. Serve with bread to soak up the sauce or if you're like C, just eat them on their own -- that's good too
